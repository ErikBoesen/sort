# Sorter
A simple collection of sorting algorithms to sort numerical arrays.

## How to use
Call `sort.algorithm(array)`, where `algorithm` is the name of the algorithm to be used in sorting, and `array` is the array you'd like to sort. Note that this will simply return a value, so if you want to replace an array with its sorted variant, you'll need to do something like this:

	exampleArray = sort.bubble(exampleArray);

Currently valid `algorithm`s:
* `bubble`
* `selection`
* 'insertion'

## Why does this exist?
* I didn't want to have to rewrite these algorithms again and again in Computer Science class
* That's pretty much all

Please DO NOT use this in classes if you don't fully understand how it works. Array sorting is an important concept to understand. Use this only if you have a full understanding of what it does and it's only going to save you time and not rob you of your education.

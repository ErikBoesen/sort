# Sorter
A simple collection of sorting algorithms to sort numerical arrays.

## How to use
Call `sort.algorithm(array)`, where `algorithm` is the name of the algorithm to be used in sorting, and `array` is the array you'd like to sort. Note that this will simply return a value, so if you want to replace an array with its sorted variant, you'll need to do something like this:

	exampleArray = sort.algorithm(exampleArray);
